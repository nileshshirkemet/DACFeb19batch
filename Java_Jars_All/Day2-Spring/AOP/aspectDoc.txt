Aspect: An aspect is a class that implements enterprise application concerns that cut across multiple classes, such as transaction management. Aspects can be a normal class configured through Spring XML configuration or we can use Spring AspectJ integration to define a class as Aspect using @Aspect annotation.

Join Point: A join point is the specific point in the application such as method execution, exception handling, changing object variable values etc. In Spring AOP a join points is always the execution of a method.

Advice: Advices are actions taken for a particular join point. In terms of programming, they are methods that gets executed when a certain join point with matching pointcut is reached in the application. You can think of Advices as Struts2 interceptors or Servlet Filters.

Pointcut: Pointcut are expressions that is matched with join points to determine whether advice needs to be executed or not. Pointcut uses different kinds of expressions that are matched with the join points and Spring framework uses the AspectJ pointcut expression language.

Target Object: They are the object on which advices are applied. Spring AOP is implemented using runtime proxies so this object is always a proxied object. What is means is that a subclass is created at runtime where the target method is overridden and advices are included based on their configuration.

AOP proxy: Spring AOP implementation uses JDK dynamic proxy to create the Proxy classes with target classes and advice invocations, these are called AOP proxy classes. We can also use CGLIB proxy by adding it as the dependency in the Spring AOP project.

Weaving: It is the process of linking aspects with other objects to create the advised proxy objects. This can be done at compile time, load time or at runtime. Spring AOP performs weaving at the runtime.
